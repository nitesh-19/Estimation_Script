# Estimate end date...

Have a long multi-day task in your hand without a deadline?<br><br>
This script tracks and estimates the time it will take to reach completion at your current rate. It logs the milestones to a text file and tells you the additional amount of work to be done to meet your goal.<br>
I wrote it to help me estimate how much time it will take me to complete a 100 days Python course if I complete 3 days of work in a day.<br>
You may use it for any such work where you know the structure of the daily work you are going to do.<br>

## How to use

Edit the script and update the parameters according to your situation.<br>
Run the script after you reach a milestone and input the amount of work completed. <br>
Read the output and be mindful of the work that is yet to be done.<br>

## Prerequisites

Python<br>
datetime library<br>
